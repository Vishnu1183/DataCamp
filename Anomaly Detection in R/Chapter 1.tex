# Plot a histogram of the nitrate column
hist(river$nitrate)


$$$$$ Visual check of normality
# Add a Nitrate concentration label 
hist(river$nitrate, xlab = "Nitrate concentration")


$$$$$ Visual check of normality
# Separate the histogram into 40 bins 
hist(river$nitrate, xlab = "Nitrate concentration", breaks = 40)


$$$$$ Grubbs' test
# Apply Grubbs' test to the river nitrate data
grubbs.test(river$nitrate)


$$$$$ Hunting multiple outliers using Grubbs' test
# Apply Grubbs' test to the nitrate data
grubbs.test(river$nitrate)

# Find row index of the max of the nitrate data
which.max(river$nitrate )


$$$$$ Hunting multiple outliers using Grubbs' test
 # Apply Grubbs' test to the nitrate data
grubbs.test(river$nitrate)

# Find row index of the max of the nitrate data
which.max(river$nitrate)

# Runs Grubbs' test excluding row 156
grubbs.test(river$nitrate[-156])


$$$$$ Hunting multiple outliers using Grubbs' test
# Apply Grubbs' test to the nitrate data
grubbs.test(river$nitrate)

# Use which.max to find row index of the max
which.max(river$nitrate)

# Runs Grubbs' test excluding row 156
grubbs.test(river$nitrate[-156])

# Print the value tested in the second Grubbs' test
max(river$nitrate[-156])


$$$$$ Visual assessment of seasonality
# View contents of dataset
head(river)

# Show the time series of nitrate concentrations with time
plot(nitrate ~ index, data = river, type = "o")


$$$$$ Visual assessment of seasonality
# View contents of dataset
head(river)

# Show the time series of nitrate concentrations with time
plot(nitrate ~ index, data = river, type = "o")

# Calculate the mean nitrate by month
monthly_mean <- tapply(river$nitrate, river$months, FUN = mean)
monthly_mean

# Plot the monthly means 
plot(monthly_mean, type = 'o', xlab = "Month", ylab = "Monthly mean")


$$$$$ Visual assessment of seasonality
# View contents of dataset
head(river)

# Show the time series of nitrate concentrations with time
plot(nitrate ~ index, data = river, type = "o")

# Calculate the mean nitrate by month
monthly_mean <- tapply(river$nitrate, river$months, FUN = mean)
monthly_mean

# Plot the monthly means 
plot(monthly_mean, type = "o", xlab = "Month", ylab = "Monthly mean")

# Create a boxplot of nitrate against months
boxplot(nitrate ~ months, data = river)


$$$$$ Seasonal Hybrid ESD algorithm 
# Run Seasonal-Hybrid ESD for nitrate concentrations
AnomalyDetectionVec(river$nitrate, period =12, direction = 'both', plot = T)


$$$$$ Interpreting Seasonal-Hybrid ESD output
# Use Seasonal-Hybrid ESD for nitrate concentrations
river_anomalies <- AnomalyDetectionVec(river$nitrate, period =12, direction = 'both', plot = T)


$$$$$ Interpreting Seasonal-Hybrid ESD output
# Use Seasonal-Hybrid ESD for nitrate concentrations
river_anomalies <- AnomalyDetectionVec(x = river$nitrate, period = 12, direction = 'both', plot = T)

# Print the anomalies
river_anomalies$anoms

# Print the plot
print(river_anomalies$plot)


$$$$$ Seasonal-Hybrid ESD versus Grubbs' test
The extra anomalies are unusual with respect to the seasonal contribution at their time of occurrence.
