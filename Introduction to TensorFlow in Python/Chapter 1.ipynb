##########################     Introduction to TensorFlow    ################
##### Defining constants with convenience functions
# Define a 3x4 tensor with all values equal to 9
x = fill([3, 4], 9)

# Define a tensor of ones with the same shape as x
y = ones_like(x)

# Define the one-dimensional vector, z
z = constant([1, 2, 3, 4])

# Print z as a numpy array
print(z.numpy())

##### Defining variables
# Define the 1-dimensional variable X
X = Variable([1, 2, 3, 4])

# Print the variable X
print(X)

# Convert X to a numpy array and assign it to Z
Z = X.numpy()

# Print the numpy array Z
print(Z)

##### Checking properties of tensors
X is a constant, Y is a variable, and X is the tensor [1, 2, 3, 4].

##### Performing element-wise multiplication
# Define tensors A0 and B0 as constants
A0 = constant([1, 2, 3, 4])
B0 = constant([[1, 2, 3], [1, 6, 4]])

# Define A1 and B1 to have the correct shape
A1 = ones_like(A0)
B1 = ones_like(B0)

# Perform element-wise multiplication
A2 = multiply(A0,A1)
B2 = multiply(B0,B1)

# Print the tensors A2 and B2
print(A2.numpy())
print(B2.numpy())

##### Making predictions with matrix multiplication
# Define X, b, and y as constants
X = constant([[1, 2], [2, 1], [5, 8], [6, 10]])
b = constant([[1], [2]])
y = constant([[6], [4], [20], [23]])

# Compute ypred using X and b
ypred = matmul(X,b)

# Compute the error as y - ypred
error = subtract(y, ypred)

##### Summing over tensor dimensions
Combined, the 5 individuals hold $50,000 in bonds.

##### Reshaping tensors
# Define input data
image = ones([16, 16])

# Reshape input data into a vector
image_vector = reshape(image, (256, 1))

# Reshape input data into a higher dimensional tensor
image_tensor = reshape(image, (4, 4, 4, 4))

##### Optimizing with gradients
# Define x as a variable equal to 0.0
x = Variable(0.0)

# Define y as x*x and apply Gradient Tape
with GradientTape() as tape:
	tape.watch(x)
	y = multiply(x,x)
	
# Compute the gradient of y with respect to x
g = tape.gradient(y, x)

# Compute and print the gradient
print(g.numpy())

##### Performing graph-based computations
# Reshape b from a 1x3 to a 3x1 tensor
b = reshape(b, (3, 1))

# Multiply L by b
L1 = matmul(L, b)

# Sum over L1, evaluate, and print
L2 = reduce_sum(L1)
print(L2.numpy())
